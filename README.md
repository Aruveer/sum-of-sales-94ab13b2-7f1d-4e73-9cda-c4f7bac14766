# Sales Summary Single-Page Application

## Description

This is a simple single-page web application that demonstrates how to fetch and process data from a CSV file using modern JavaScript. It dynamically calculates the total sales from a `data.csv` file and displays the result on the page. The application is styled using the Bootstrap 5 framework.

## Features

- Fetches data from a local `data.csv` file.
- Parses the CSV data to extract sales figures.
- Calculates the sum of the 'sales' column.
- Displays the total sales dynamically on the webpage.
- Styled with Bootstrap 5 for a clean and responsive layout.

## How to Run

To run this project, simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. No web server is required for this basic implementation.

1.  Ensure all files (`index.html`, `script.js`, `data.csv`) are in the same directory.
2.  Open `index.html` in your browser.

The page will load, and the script will automatically fetch the data and display the total sales.
